# Facade Design Pattern

This project is an implementation of the Facade Design Pattern. It demonstrates how to use the Facade pattern to simplify the process of handling different payment methods.

## Usage
To run this project, you need to compile the Main.java file and run the binary.

```bash
  $ javac src/main/java/Main.java
  $ java src/main/java/Main
```

The program provides a simplified interface for making payments using different payment providers, such as PayPal, PagSeguro, and Pix. The PaymentFacade class acts as a facade, abstracting the complexities of the payment process and providing a unified interface for the client code.
