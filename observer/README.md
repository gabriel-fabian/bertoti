# Observer Design Pattern

This project is an implementation of the Observer Design Pattern. It demonstrates how to use the Observer pattern to create a group chat system, where group members are notified when new messages are sent.

## Usage
To run this project, you need to compile the Main.java file and run the binary.

```bash
  $ javac src/main/java/Main.java
  $ java src/main/java/Main
```

The program simulates a group chat, where multiple group members can join and receive notifications when new messages are sent. The GroupChat class is the main class that manages the addition and removal of observers and sends notifications to all observers when a new message is sent.
